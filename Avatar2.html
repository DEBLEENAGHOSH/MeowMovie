    <p1><ul class="text-center px-5" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by James Cameron. He co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series. It follows a blue-skinned humanoid Na'vi named Jake Sully (Worthington) as he and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan of Pandora, a habitable exomoon on which they live.After repeated delays in the expected release schedule, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered in London on December 6, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16, 2022.The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing over $2.32 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time.

      <p><ul class="a" style="color: black;font-size: 20px;font-weight: 300;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    <li>Sam Worthington as the voice and motion-capture of Jake Sully, a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become Na'vi and is now chief of the Omatikaya.</li>
    <li>Zoe Saldaña as the voice and motion-capture of Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite (Neytiri Sully), the daughter of the previous clan chief, future Tsahìk of the clan, and Jake's mate.</li>
    <li>Sigourney Weaver as the voice and motion-capture of Kiri te Suli Kireysi'ite (Kiri Sully), the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's Na'vi avatar who was adopted by Jake and Neytiri.Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human scientist who took the side of the Na'vi and died during the conflict. Her Na'vi avatar is revealed to have birthed Kiri despite her death. Like most of the cast, she learned free-diving for the film and filmed scenes underwater.</li>
    <li>Stephen Lang as the voice and motion-capture of Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human military officer who led the paramilitary security division of the RDA in their conflict with the Na'vi.After being killed by Neytiri in 2154, he is revived as a Recombinant[18] and seeks revenge against Jake and his family. Cameron said in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating, "I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga." He later said Quaritch would act as the main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.</li>
    <li>Kate Winslet as the voice and motion-capture of Ronal, a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife who is pregnant.Winslet called Ronal "a pivotal character in the ongoing story" but also "relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot" since shooting all her scenes only took a month.It marks her first time working with performance capture, and motion capture altogether. She, like most of the cast, also had to learn free diving for the film; while filming an underwater scene, she held her breath for over seven minutes, a new record for any film scene shot underwater.</li>
    <li>Cliff Curtis as the voice and motion-capture of Tonowari, the chief of the Metkayina clan and Ronal's husband.</li>
    <li>Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a former member of the Avatar Program who chose to side with the Na'vi in the first film.</li>

    <li>Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore, the commander in charge of the RDA's interests.</li>
    <li>Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby, the head of an RDA private sector marine hunting vessel on the planet of Pandora.</li>
    <li>Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin, a marine biologist working for the RDA.</li>
    <li>Jamie Flatters as the voice and motion-capture of Neteyam te Suli Tsyeyk'itan (Neteyam Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 16-year-old son and oldest child.</li>

    <li>Jack Champion as Miles "Spider" Socorro, the 16-year-old son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was raised by scientists who stayed back on Pandora and wears Na'vi attire and an oxygen mask when outside a building. He is inseparable from Jake and Neytiri's children.</li>
    <li>Bailey Bass as the voice and motion-capture of Tsireya ("Reya"), a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal's daughter</li>
    <li>Filip Geljo as the voice and motion-capture of Aonung, a young male hunter, a free diver of the Metkayina, and Tonowari and Ronal's son</li>
    <li>Duane Evans, Jr. as voice and motion-capture of Rotxo, a young male hunter and free diver of the Metkayina</li>
    <li>Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the former corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation, who appears in a recording made for Quaritch's Recombinant.</li>
    <li>Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who worked in the Avatar Program and came to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA in the first film.</li>
    <li>Matt Gerald as the voice and motion-capture of Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who fought and died in the RDA's battle against the Na'vi in 2154 where he was trampled by a Hammerhead titanothere. Following the RDA's return to Pandora, he is revived as a recombinant and placed under Quaritch's command. Gerald was announced to reprise his role in August 2017.</li>
